1.
Start writing unit tests for the functionality you wrote with co-pilot.
Use pytest for your tests
1.1 Examine the test cases that co-pilot suggests, do they cover all code paths?
1.2 What about fixtures, can co-pilot guess what data you need?

2.
What if we change our original implementation?
2.1
Alter your functionality and approach altering the test in two ways
1. edit the tests
2. remove and rewrite

What leads to the best collaboration with co-pilot?
